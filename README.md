# cheekymonkey
A spelling game written in Javascript, featuring lots of monkeys.

This game is adapted from a game I originally made using PowerPoint. I have not yet implemented all the features I planned, and the images need to be replaced with public domain or Creative Commons-licensed images.

The numbered circles on the game's home screen are buttons that display a random image representing a vocabulary word. The number of letters in the vocabulary word corresponds to the number on the button. Students get a number of points (referred to as "bananas") for spelling a word correctly; the number of points awarded is equal to the length of the word they spelled.

My original rules for the game incorporate a "bank" or "vault" system: after spelling a word correctly, a player may choose to "bank" their bananas earned during that turn, which ends the turn but keeps the bananas safe, or they may choose to generate a new word to spell. If a player spells a word incorrectly, their turn ends, and they lose all bananas earned during that turn.

After an image/word is generated, clicking on it displays a randomly-selected animated gif of a monkey (actually, other non-monkey primates are included). According to my original rules, if the "cheeky monkey" gif—a gif of a monkey running away with bananas—appears, the effect is the same as if the player spelled a word incorrectly; that is, their turn ends, and they lose all bananas earned during that turn. This is intended to provide some balance against players or teams who might otherwise dominate the game with superior spelling ability.

Another element of the original rules are that a player must start each turn by clicking the "3" button, and attempting to spell the generated three-letter word. If they choose to continue, they must attempt a four-letter word, then a five-letter word, and so on.

These rules are not integral to the game, however; it is easy to add or change rules however you see fit.
